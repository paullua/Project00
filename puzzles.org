No help from me! Or brother Neff! Or any professor!
Other rando's ... sure.  Other students ... even bettar!

To get full "extra credit" you must fill out all four. 
Solutions and proofs are different.  Solving a puzzle like the bomb puzzle in a previous lab
is much different than proving it is impossible if we don't know if the bomb is heavier or lighter
with only 2 weights!

  How many numbers between one and a million contain the digit 1 exactly once,
  and the sum of the rest of the digits is 16? Write elisp code with and without
  loops to verify your answer.

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'cl) ;; <-- this is necessary, as loop is defined in the cl package

  Sequences can be non-numeric as well. What is the pattern for this sequence?
: [m b w y me be wi yo met bew ith you meta bewi thyo uati metap bewit hyoua tirel]
  How long can it continue?
*** Rephrase
Find the pattern in the sequence and find how long the sequence can continue.

*** Approach
I will use the title of the text book (Metaphors Be With You: A Tireless Work On Play On Words)
to finish the sequence.

*** Solution
There are 44 characters in the text book title (excluding spaces and punctuation).

The first 4 items of the sequence are the first letters of the first 4 words of
the title of the text book. The next 4 in the sequence still use the title, but
it is then divided into 2 characters per item in the sequence, using the same positions
from the previous 4. This pattern continues until the last 4 items in the sequence 
each have 11 characters. This means that there will be 44 items in the sequence in total.

*** Proof
And now, presenting, the greatest of all proofs! Well... I guess that's a bit objective
(but not object programming since we are focusing on functional programming).
Well, on with the proof!

To prove what was explained in the solution, I shall type out the entirety of the 
sequence:

[m b w y 
 me be wi yo 
 met bew ith you 
 meta bewi thyo uati 
 metap bewit hyoua tirel
 metaph bewith youati reless
 metapho bewithy ouatire lesswor

** TODO WRA
  Why is the sum of the reciprocals of the powers of two scaled by which power
  equal to two?
*** Rephrase
Explain why the summation for i = 0 to infinity (1/2^i) is equal to 2.

*** Approach
I will use a graph, calculus, and other mathy tools to explain why this summation
equals 2.

*** Solution
If we look at the first several items we get the following:

1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...

The first few items of the sequence add up to 1.875. If we continue down the series
we get closer and closer to 2 but never actually reaching it.

1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + 1/32 + 1/64 + 1/128 + 1/256 + 1/512 = 1.99804... 

As the series continues, the denominator becomes larger and each item in the sequence approaches zero. 
Given that this this series goes to infinity and by an understanding of limits in calculus, we can see
that this series converges to the value 2.
